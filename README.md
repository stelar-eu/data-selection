# Overview
This repository contains software for dataset selection from the KLMS Data Catalog in project [STELAR](https://stelar-project.eu/).

This is a customized, comprehensive web-based GUI that extends the Data Catalog’s capabilities for search, navigation, comparison and ranking among available datasets in order to facilitate users of the KLMS in dataset selection. 

It emphasizes relevant filtering criteria, such as *geospatial regions*, *time intervals*, *textual features* (e.g., keywords, organizations), allowing to fully leverage the automated metadata extracted by the [Data Profiler](https://github.com/stelar-eu/data-profiler). It also allows dataset *comparison* and *ranking* according to multiple criteria and user preferences, rather than simply presenting lists of search results. This GUI can significantly assist users in data preparation, i.e., data selection and data wrangling, and offer more insights about the suitability of the various datasets for their pipelines and analysis tasks in processing workflows executed in the KLMS.
